# Ingest API - Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, a server stub was easily generated.

This server uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.8.10 or newer, preferably

The server uses PySpark to communicate with the data lake. It is included in `requirements.txt`.

## Environment variables

| Name | Description | Examples | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| INGEST_BASE_PATH | the path where the application should store the data | `hdfs://<IP>:<PORT>/` | `file:///tmp/` |

## Usage

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
