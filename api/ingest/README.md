# Ingest API

API meant for Smart Home data ingestion. It's also through this API that the "forget" feature can be executed, which performs deletion of records associated with a specific Smart Home (identified by an UUID).

The API's code was generated using Swagger Codegen, and the specification is available in the `openapi.yaml` file.
Both the server code and client SDK are available.
